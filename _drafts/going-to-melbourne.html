    The time to leave had come and me and Lisa decided to head for the buss.
    Packing up my things, making sure I had everything, I left the room and
    handed in the linen sheets.
  </p>
  <p>
    We were leaving at 7pm and it would be a 12 hour long trip ahead, so I
    decided now would probably be a good time to go buy that E-reader I've
    been thinking of getting for so long.
   </p>

    Said and done, an hour or two later I was the owner of an "Kobo Aura".
    I was thinking of picking up the slightly more expensive version that
    would be water resistant, but I quckly gave up that silly idea. When
    all comes to it, why would I ever be in need of reading in the water?
    Now you might say, "...but hey, you could use it in a pool?", which
    I agree would be a good thing, but then again when something is "water
    resistant" it's not always in the way we expect it. Often it is more
    the case of "the product can be submerged in water up to one meter for
    two minutes." Atleast in this case it was like that.

    The rest of the trip went uneventfull, I wish I had some kind of picture
    to show you, but basicly it was just riding a bus in the dark of the night,
    not very interesting to say the least.
