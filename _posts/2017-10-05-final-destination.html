    Lost and confused I touched down at Sydney airport. Most of the confusion stemmed
    from the fact that I slept during the last 20 minutes of the flight, resulting in
    the cabin crew deciding to not hand me the form about what possessions I would like
    to declare when entering the country.
  </p>

  <p>
    Seeing all the passenger walking around the yellow forms in their hands made my anxiety
    levels heighten a bit, but a quick inquiry with the staff working the customs made it
    clear it was no biggie, it would be available further ahead.
  </p>

  <p>
    I made my way down to the luggage extraction conveyor belts, where I waited around for
    my luggage to arrive. The luggage started arriving, but my backpack was nowhere in sight.
    After having waited around for about 15 minutes I started feeling worried again, but five
    minutes later it finally arrived.

  <h2>Customs</h2>

  <p>
    Making my way down to the customs I prepared myself for a long process of declaring my
    possessions before I could enter the country, after all I had watched some episodes of
    border security Australia before going here...
  </p>

  <p>
    I started filling out the yellow form, carefully making sure I had understood everything
    on it correct, then I handed it to one of the customs staff, who took a quick glance at
    it, then pointed me in a new direction to go. Perfect all I would need to do now is to
    pass the individual questioning of new arrivals, then I would be able to enter the country,
    at least that's how it works on TV.
  </p>

  <p>
    To my confusion I found myself in the "arrivals" section of the airport.
    No questioning or anything.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was in.

  <h2>Getting to the Hostel</h2>

  <p>
    I connected my phone to the airport-wifi and started looking for a way to get to the hostel,
    apparently it would be located in the centre of Sydney, it's small thing like that, that
    I've ought to have looked up beforehand.
  </p>

  <p>
    Luckily for me the trains ran just under the airport which made getting to Sydney central a
    rather trivial matter. A one way ticket later, and I was on my way.
  </p>

  <p>
    The trains were larger than ones I had seen i Sweden, they also had two levels and a cool system
    for adjusting the back of the seat. In hindsight I wish I had remembered to take a picture of it,
    but by this point 20 - 30 hours of sleep deprivation had made my brain have other priorities.
  </p>

  <p>
    After riding the train for about 15-20 minutes I got of at the central station. I was then I came
    to the realization that I had no idea of where to go, it wouldn't be as easy as to look it up on
    google maps neither, as I hadn't gotten any phone plan yet.
  </p>

  <p>
     About 20 uneventfull minutes of navigating my way around the block like it was the 90's,
     I finally found the hostel. I walked up to the reception and was immediately uppgraded to
     a 4-share dorm instead of the 8-share one I had booked. Score! :D
  </p>

  <p>
    Deciding to first drop off my luggage, I then proceded to the rooftop where the was rumored
    to be a bar. I needed a drink!
  </p>

  <p>
    I stepped out on the ninth floor and into a ...mexican poolparty?? :O
    Everywhere there were people dressed in sombreros drinking drinks listening to EDM music, at
    one point some people even decided to jump into the pool with their clothes on.
  </p>

  <p>
    I couldn't handle this at the moment, so I stepped out on the "not-so-party"-balcony and decided
    to call my parents to let them know I was still alive. Meanwhile i took a photo of the view.
  </p>

  <p>Maybe tomorrow I would join the mexican-madness...</p>
