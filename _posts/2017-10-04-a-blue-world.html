    <p>
      The low humming sound of the jet engines accompanied me as I looked out of the window.
      Outside a landscape of clouds whizzed by in, well... whatever speed a plane could reach
      in this day and age.
    </p>

    <p>
      I stared out into the blue void for a while, pondering on the thought of what was to come.
      As I averted my gaze I rubbed the crust out of my eyes and peered down on my watch. The
      clock-handles showed the time as five past ten, just about morning in Sweden, normally I
      would still be snoozing in my bed.

    <p>
      Not today though. Today would mark the day I would finally get to achive one of my lifelong
      goals ; becoming a backpacker for a year.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today would be the day I would leave for Australia.

  <h3>The flights</h3>

  <p>
    The first flight had gone well, almost a little too well to be honest. I had started in
    Landvetter, Gothenburg to travel up to Stockholm for one hour, from there I would then
    board the second flight to travel to Doha, Qatar for six hours.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was during the first flight I would come to discover that I would have noone sitting
    next to me, a pattern which repeated itself for the second flight, where I had the middle
    seat and noone beside me neither to the left or the right. On that flight i slept laying
    horizontally across the seats. :D
  </p>

  <p>
    Arriving in Doha, I was amazed by how large the airport was, like a smaller city almost.
    I wandered around in this maze of an airport untill finally arriving at my gate where I
    would board the last flight to Sydney. The last stretch would also be the longest one,
    timing in on around 14 hours. On this flight I wasn't as lucky, next to me sat a timid
    asian businessman, which wasn't a problem at all, what was the problem was the brittish
    couple sitting next to him. The couple were loud and brought with them their infant child
    ... who was even louder.

  <p>Just after take-off the baby decided to start screaming,
  an activity that seemed to never end.</p>

  <p>
    It would come to be the longest 14-hours of my life. <br> Karma is a bitch like that...

    (BTW: Sorry for the stockphotos, my photographer side decided to take a vacation too... :P)
